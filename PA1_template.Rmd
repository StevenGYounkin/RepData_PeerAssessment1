## Loading and preprocessing the data

load data in unzipped activity.csv file
```{r}
data <- read.csv("activity.csv")
```

## What is mean total number of steps taken per day?

Calculate total steps per day ignoring intervals with missing data (na) and plot histogram
```{r}
s1 <- split(data, data$date)
Steps_Per_Day <- sapply(s1, function(x) sum(x[, "steps"], na.rm=T))
hist(Steps_Per_Day)
```

Calculate and display mean total steps per day
```{r}
print(mean(Steps_Per_Day))
```

Calculate and display median total steps per day
```{r}
print(median(Steps_Per_Day))
```




## What is the average daily activity pattern?



## Imputing missing values



## Are there differences in activity patterns between weekdays and weekends?
